# Overview
The `fpm_environment` module in Fortran provides a suite of procedures to inspect and interact with the system's programming environment. This includes determining the operating system type, retrieving and modifying environment variables, getting command-line arguments, and providing platform-specific information like path separators and library file naming conventions. It uses Fortran's intrinsic capabilities and also interfaces with C functions (presumably from `fpm_environment.c`) for certain low-level operations like setting/unsetting environment variables.

# Key Components
- **OS Type Detection**:
  - `OS_UNKNOWN`, `OS_LINUX`, `OS_MACOS`, `OS_WINDOWS`, `OS_CYGWIN`, `OS_SOLARIS`, `OS_FREEBSD`, `OS_OPENBSD`: Integer parameters defining constants for different operating systems.
  - `get_os_type()`: A function that attempts to determine the current operating system by checking environment variables (`OSTYPE`, `OS`) and the existence of specific system files. It caches the result for subsequent calls.
  - `OS_NAME(os)`: A pure function that returns a string representation (e.g., "Linux", "Windows") for a given OS integer constant.
  - `os_is_unix(os)`: A logical function that returns `.true.` if the OS is not Windows.
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `get_env(NAME, DEFAULT)`: A function to retrieve the value of an environment variable. Returns an optional default value if the variable is not set or is blank.
  - `set_env(name, value, overwrite)`: A logical function to set an environment variable. It interfaces with a C function `c_setenv`.
  - `delete_env(name)`: A logical function to delete an environment variable. It interfaces with a C function `c_unsetenv`.
- **Command-Line Arguments**:
  - `get_command_arguments_quoted()`: A function that retrieves command-line arguments (starting from the second argument, typically after a subcommand) and returns them as a single string, with arguments containing spaces appropriately quoted.
- **Filesystem Utilities**:
  - `separator()`: A function that attempts to determine the pathname separator (`/` or `\`) for the current system.
  - `library_filename(package_name, shared, import, target_os)`: A pure function that constructs the appropriate library filename (e.g., `lib<name>.so`, `lib<name>.dll`, `lib<name>.a`) based on the package name, whether it's shared or static, whether it's an import library (for Windows DLLs), and the target OS.
- **C Interoperability Utilities**:
  - `f2cs(f, c)`: A pure subroutine to convert a Fortran string to a C-compatible allocatable array of `c_char` (null-terminated). This is used internally when calling C functions like `c_setenv` and `c_unsetenv`.
  - Interfaces for `c_setenv` and `c_unsetenv`: These define the Fortran interface to the C functions responsible for setting and unsetting environment variables. (These C functions are defined in `fpm_environment.c`). These interfaces are conditionally compiled out if `FPM_BOOTSTRAP` is defined.

# Important Variables/Constants
- **`OS_*` parameters**: Integer constants used throughout fpm to represent different operating systems.
- `first_run`, `ret` (in `get_os_type`): Saved variables used to cache the OS type determination, making subsequent calls faster. `!$omp threadprivate` is used, suggesting consideration for threaded environments.

# Usage Examples
- **Determining OS and acting accordingly**:
  ```fortran
  use fpm_environment
  integer :: my_os
  my_os = get_os_type()
  if (my_os == OS_WINDOWS) then
      print *, "Running on Windows. Path separator: ", separator()
  else if (my_os == OS_LINUX) then
      print *, "Running on Linux. Path separator: ", separator()
  end if
  ```
- **Getting an environment variable**:
  ```fortran
  use fpm_environment
  character(len=:), allocatable :: user_path
  user_path = get_env("PATH", "/usr/bin:/bin") ! Get PATH, default if not set
  print *, "Current PATH (or default): ", user_path
  ```
- **Setting/Deleting an environment variable**:
  ```fortran
  use fpm_environment
  logical :: success
  success = set_env("FPM_TEMP_VAR", "some_value", .true.) ! Overwrite if exists
  if (success) then
      print *, "FPM_TEMP_VAR set."
      success = delete_env("FPM_TEMP_VAR")
      if (success) then
          print *, "FPM_TEMP_VAR deleted."
      else
          print *, "Failed to delete FPM_TEMP_VAR."
      end if
  else
      print *, "Failed to set FPM_TEMP_VAR."
  end if
  ```
- **Generating a library filename**:
  ```fortran
  use fpm_environment
  character(len=:), allocatable :: lib_name
  lib_name = library_filename("mygreatlib", .true., .false., OS_LINUX) ! -> "libmygreatlib.so"
  print *, "Shared library name for Linux: ", lib_name
  lib_name = library_filename("mygreatlib", .true., .true., OS_WINDOWS) ! -> "libmygreatlib.lib" (import lib for DLL)
  print *, "Import library name for Windows: ", lib_name
  ```

# Dependencies and Interactions
- **`iso_fortran_env`**: For standard I/O units and `command_argument_count`, `get_command_argument`, `get_environment_variable`.
- **`iso_c_binding`**: For `c_char`, `c_int`, `c_null_char` used in C interoperability.
- **`fpm_error`**: For `fpm_stop` (though not explicitly used in the provided snippet, it's a common import).
- **`fpm_environment.c`**: This Fortran module defines interfaces to C functions (`c_setenv`, `c_unsetenv`) that are implemented in `fpm_environment.c`. These C functions handle the actual system calls for setting and unsetting environment variables.
- **Operating System**: The module's behavior, particularly `get_os_type`, `separator`, `library_filename`, and the C interop functions, is highly dependent on the underlying operating system.
- **OpenMP**: The `get_os_type` function uses `!$omp threadprivate` for its cached variables, indicating it's designed to be safe in OpenMP threaded contexts by giving each thread its own copy of `ret` and `first_run`.
- The module is used by various other fpm modules (e.g., `fpm_command_line` for OS type, `fpm_compiler` for OS-dependent flags and library names, `fpm_model` for environment interaction).
